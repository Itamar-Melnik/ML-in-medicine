# Machine Learning in Medicine – Course Assignments

This repository contains two separate course assignments applying machine learning techniques to medical data, primarily using the MIMIC dataset for mortality prediction in ICU settings.

## What's Inside
- **Task1.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for the first assignment – introductory ML task on medical data (basic preprocessing, exploration, and modeling).

- **Task3.ipynb**  
  Jupyter Notebook for the advanced assignment (stronger/more comprehensive part) – deeper feature engineering, advanced modeling, evaluation metrics, and insights on mortality prediction.

- **MIMIC_data_sample_mortality.csv**  
  Sample dataset from MIMIC-III/IV used for both tasks (focus on patient mortality prediction based on clinical features).

- **למידת מכונה ברפואה- מטלה 3.docx**  
  Written report/submission document for Task 3 (in Hebrew).

## Project Goals
- **Task 1**: Get familiar with medical datasets, perform basic EDA, preprocessing, and simple ML models on healthcare data.
- **Task 3** (stronger part): Tackle real-world challenges in medical ML – handling imbalanced data, advanced algorithms, interpretability, and clinical relevance for predicting patient outcomes (e.g., mortality risk).

## Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn (classification models, metrics)  
- Likely: imbalanced-learn (for handling class imbalance), matplotlib/seaborn (visualizations)
